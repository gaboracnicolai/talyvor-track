// govulncheck_gate_test.go — the supply-chain gate exists, and it is a JOB rather than a word.
//
// W6.33 measured this repo's actual state on clean main `928bd981`: `govulncheck ./...` reported
// ELEVEN CALLED vulnerabilities — CALLED, not the separate "in modules you require but your code
// doesn't appear to call" bucket govulncheck counts on its own line — and
// `grep -c govulncheck .github/workflows/ci.yaml` was ZERO. talyvor-lens had gated on govulncheck
// every build for the whole session; track, which holds the issue tracker's Postgres, was not
// watched at all. The asymmetry was as much the finding as the eleven were.
//
// ⚠ WHY A TEST AND NOT JUST THE YAML. The eleven were not introduced by one bad commit — they
// accumulated because NOTHING WOULD EVER SAY SO. That failure mode returns in full the moment the
// job is deleted or renamed, and deleting a job is a GREEN diff: every remaining check still
// passes, so nothing in CI objects to CI losing a check. This test is the thing that objects.
//
// ⚠⚠ AND IT IGNORES COMMENTS, DELIBERATELY — a substring check here would be the exact
// "documented but not wired" shape this queue keeps catching. The word "govulncheck" already
// appears in this repo's PROSE in several places: go.mod's toolchain rationale names it, and so
// does toolchain_pin_test.go, and ci.yaml's own job carries a long comment about it. A guard that
// grepped the raw file would therefore stay GREEN over a ci.yaml whose vuln job had been deleted
// and whose comment survived. Comment lines are stripped before anything is matched, and the
// match is on the INVOCATION (`govulncheck ./...`), not the name: `go install` alone is not a
// scan. The mutation controls for both of those are in TestTheGovulncheckGateGuardCanFail.

// literal " # " inside a genuine command would be truncated here and the gate reported MISSING,
// which is a false RED. A guard that fails loudly on an odd line is recoverable; one that passes
// on a comment is the defect this whole file exists to prevent.
