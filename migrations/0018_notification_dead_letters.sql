-- 0018_notification_dead_letters.sql
--
-- Dead-letter table for email notifications. When the async delivery queue
-- exhausts all retry attempts for a message (e.g. SMTP down for an extended
-- window), the give-up is recorded here instead of being silently dropped, so
-- an admin can see which notifications failed and follow up.
--
-- Metadata only: recipients, subject, attempt count, and the last error. The
-- rendered body is intentionally NOT stored — this is an ops surface, not a
-- copy of notification content.
--
-- Additive and idempotent (CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS); inert until email is
-- enabled (EMAIL_ENABLED) and a delivery permanently fails.
