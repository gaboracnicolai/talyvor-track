"""Every control script that mutates a tracked file and restores it in a `finally` must also
install a restoring SIGNAL HANDLER — because a `finally` does not run on SIGTERM.

WHY THIS EXISTS, MEASURED RATHER THAN SUPPOSED — AND IT WAS MEASURED IN talyvor-suite, NOT HERE,
WHICH IS THE POINT OF PORTING IT. A 2-minute command timeout SIGTERM'd a control script mid-control
(talyvor-suite W1.7, merge 78c69c8). The `finally` never ran and the working tree was left with
`deploy/decision-expiry.sh` reading `if true; then` where a gate had been. It was reproduced on
demand in talyvor-suite `5de27e3`: same kill, same file — with a handler nothing was stranded,
without one the mutated file was left in the tree.

⚠ NOTHING IN THIS REPOSITORY HAD EVER LOOKED FOR IT. At f8e7236, 43 of this repo's scripts
mutate-and-restore and ZERO installed a handler — the estate-wide count was 163 scripts and 3
protected, all three in the one repo that had been bitten.

⚠ NOTHING ABOUT THAT TREE LOOKED WRONG. `pnpm test` had passed minutes earlier, `git status`
showed only files the session had edited on purpose, and the diff was one line inside a table that
had legitimately been touched. It was found only because the NEXT harness refused to score against
a red baseline. The stranded state is the dangerous kind: a kill landing on a control whose
mutation WEAKENS a guard leaves that weakening in the tree with a green suite.

⚠⚠ AND THIS IS A GUARD RATHER THAN A BATCH OF EDITS BECAUSE A POPULATION NAMED IN PROSE DOES NOT
STOP GROWING — measured in talyvor-suite, where the fix sat in one file while the directory grew by
twelve scripts and the unprotected count went UP. The allowlist below may only SHRINK: R2 fails on
an entry that has been fixed, so the list cannot rot into a permanent excuse, and R1 fails on a NEW
unprotected mutator, so the count cannot climb.

⚠ DETECTION IS SYNTACTIC, NOT A GREP, AND THAT IS LOAD-BEARING HERE RATHER THAN STYLISTIC.
In talyvor-suite `grep -l signal scripts/*.py` reports a script as PROTECTED whose only
occurrences of the word are four sentences of English in comments. A regex reads the documentation
as the implementation; `ast` does not see comments.

⚠ AND THE TWO POPULATIONS DIFFER HERE TOO, MEASURED ON THIS TREE AT f8e7236: `grep -l finally:
scripts/*.py` counts 60, this walk counts 43. A `finally` that does not WRITE is not a restore, and
seventeen scripts in this directory have one.

WHAT COUNTS AS A MUTATOR: a script containing a `try` whose `finally` performs a write —
`.write_text` / `.write_bytes` / `.writelines` / `.write`, or `shutil`/`os` copy/move. That is the
restore, and a script that restores is a script that mutated.

WHAT COUNTS AS PROTECTED: a call to `signal.signal(...)`. This does NOT verify the handler
restores correctly or re-raises; it verifies one is installed. Converting a script needs its own
SIGTERM control — kill it mid-mutation with the handler, and again without it, and require the
second to strand what the first restores. A handler nobody has watched work is the same thing as
no handler.

THE SHAPE TO COPY IS BELOW rather than a pointer into another repository, because a cross-repo
pointer is a claim nothing in this repo can check:

    def restore_on_signal(snapshot: dict) -> None:
        def handler(signum, _frame):
            for path, blob in snapshot.items():
                try:
                    path.write_bytes(blob)
                except OSError:
                    pass
            sys.stderr.write("\n!! signal %d — restored %d file(s)\n" % (signum, len(snapshot)))
            signal.signal(signum, signal.SIG_DFL)
            os.kill(os.getpid(), signum)
        for s in (signal.SIGTERM, signal.SIGINT, signal.SIGHUP):
            signal.signal(s, handler)

Install it AFTER the snapshot exists, and re-install it if the snapshot changes. Re-raising with
SIG_DFL keeps the exit status honest: a caller that killed the process still sees it die of that
signal rather than exit 0 with a tidy tree. SIGKILL still strands and nothing in Python can change
that; the defence there is a harness that refuses to score against a red baseline.

Usage:  python3 scripts/check-restore-signal-handlers.py
Exit 0 = every mutator is protected or listed; non-zero names what changed.

# A SINGLE FLOOR OVER THE UNION OF TWO DETECTORS IS SATISFIED BY EITHER DETECTOR ALONE. Measured
# by tab-r7k2 in bfa11f4: stubbing the WIDE detector to `return False` came back GREEN, because
# the narrow one held the union count up — so the widened definition, the entire point of having
# two, could have silently reverted with the guard green. A vacuity floor over a union is not a
# vacuity floor. Controls G10/G11 blind each detector separately for exactly this reason.
#
# Both are FLOORS ON THE DETECTOR, not targets for the tree: a walk that stops recognising its
# shape reports a clean directory. Deleting scripts is legitimate — lower the floor in the same
# diff, with the deletions visible.

# The scripts that mutate-and-restore and do NOT yet install a handler, measured at f17a584.
# ⚠ THIS LIST MAY ONLY SHRINK. Adding to it is not a fix; R1 exists so that a new script cannot be
# written without a handler, and R2 exists so that a fixed script cannot be left listed.
# ⚠⚠ THIS LIST GREW FROM 60 TO 89 IN THE SAME MERGE THAT WIDENED THE DETECTOR, AND THAT IS NOT A
# REGRESSION — READ THIS BEFORE CONCLUDING THE "MAY ONLY SHRINK" RULE WAS BROKEN.
# The previous detector recognised a restore only as a write CALL syntactically inside a `finally`.
# It therefore saw ~63 restoring scripts where there are 95: it was blind to a `finally` that calls
# a helper (`finally: restore()`), to a CONTEXT MANAGER whose `__exit__` writes, and to a `finally`
# that shells out to `git checkout --`. Those 29 scripts were ALWAYS unprotected; they were simply
# not in the population, so nothing counted them. The number went up because the instrument got
# better, not because the tree got worse — and a smaller list under a blinder detector is the
# flattering direction, which is the one this whole class of guard exists to refuse.
#
# THE RULE STILL HOLDS AND IT IS THE SAME RULE: within a fixed detector this list may only SHRINK.
# R2 fails on an entry that has been fixed, R1 on a new unprotected script, R4 on a stale entry.
# If the detector is widened again, say so here in the same diff, with the before/after counts.
