"""W6.44 — controls for the NAME half of `w634-toolchain-pin-controls.py --check-anchors`.

`--check-anchors` used to verify only that each control's ANCHOR still applies. A campaign rots
from TWO ends: the thing it mutates, and the test it expects to break. talyvor-code #76 is the
demonstration (w420's C4 expected a test deleted in the same refactor that moved its anchor, and
that rot stayed hidden behind the anchor one). This merge adds the second check here.

⚠ THE MEASUREMENT SAID THERE IS NOTHING ROTTEN TO FIX TODAY — all four names this campaign
references exist. So the guard passed on its first run, and that is precisely when this project's
rule says to suspect it. F4 is the control that decides whether it is a guard or a decoration: it
blinds the source walk and requires a red, because a walk returning nothing verifies every name
FOR FREE against a tree it never read.

⚠ F3 IS INVERTED: an untouched tree must stay GREEN.

Mutates tracked files, restores them in a `finally` with sha256 compared, and installs a signal
handler — a `finally` does not run on SIGTERM (scripts/check-restore-signal-handlers.py).
